# clojure-functions

This repo contains some code defining three simple clojure functions, written as part of an assignment with the purpose of practicing writing code in the functional paradigm. 

The three functions are the following:

my-max: Takes in a list and returns the biggest value.

my-reverse: Takes in a list and returns it reversed.

my-map: Takes in a list and a function, returns a new list where the elements are the result of applying the function to each element in the original list.
